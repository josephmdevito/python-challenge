This is a README file to accompany Homework #3 for the Northwestern Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp. 
In this challenge, I synthesized fundamental skills in python scripting to analyze two data sets and draw results from the provided data.
My results from these two analyses are in the "analysis" folders within the PyBank and PyPoll folders of the repository. 
The files in this directory were created by Joseph DeVito using python scripting in VS Code, with collaboration from Corbin Moore and guidance from Asiha Braxton-Garvin and Jesse Wright.
